1. I have 100 oranges, numbered 1 to 100. I want to place every orange with a number divisible by 3 in one pile, every orange divisible by 5 in another pile, every other orange divisible by 3 AND 5 in a third pile, and finally every orange that is not divisible by 3 or 5 in a fourth pile. 
2. I have three stacks of paper, each with 100 pages, that must be combined in this order: a page from stack 1, a page from stack 2, and a page from stack 3. The process must then start again until all three stacks have been combined. Describe this process. 
3. I am shown random integers. Some numbers could be negative. The numbers are in no particular order, and I am only shown all of the numbers one at a time, once. How would I determine the maximum number seen? The minimum? The average? 
4. I need to say the integers 1 to 100. However, when an integer is a multiple of 3 I need to say "cove" instead. For numbers that are a multiple of 5, I need to say "valence" instead. For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, I need to say "covalence" instead. 
5. Go through a stack of documents and determine the first document encountered that has an author name of John Doe. 
6. Given a stack of documents, reverse the stack. 
7. Given a collection of CDs, return the collection to the owner with all the Maroon 5 discs removed. 
8. Given a baseball card collection, determine whether all the cards are from the year 2007 or not. Your answer will be a single yes/no. 
9. Given a book, create your own book composed of only the odd pages of the original book. 
10. Given a list of sentences, create your own list of sentences that are the same sentences, but all uppercase. 
11. Given a list of candidates, provide a list composed of only those candidates having a name longer than 15 characters 
12. Given a stack of orders, determine whether any of the orders are for french fries. Your answer will be a single yes/no. 
13. Given any positive integer, derive the reversed representation of that integer using only math. Ex: 310 => 013 (13 OK), 415 => 514.
